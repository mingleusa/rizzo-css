# SvelteKit + Rizzo CSS

This project was scaffolded with `npx rizzo-css init` (Svelte).

## First-time setup

**Install dependencies before running any SvelteKit command:**

```bash
pnpm install
# or: npm install
```

Then start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The theme selected during `rizzo-css init` is set in `src/app.html` (`data-theme`) and is used on first load when you have no saved preference in the browser.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` — Start dev server
- `pnpm build` — Build for production
- `pnpm preview` — Preview production build
