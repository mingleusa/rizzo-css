# Sound effects

Place your click sound file here for the site’s “Play sound on click” feature.

- **Recommended:** `click.mp3` or `click.wav` (short, subtle click)
- The layout script will try `/sfx/click.mp3` first, then `/sfx/click.wav`
- If no file is found, a built-in Web Audio tone is used as fallback
- Enable the sound in **Settings → Play sound on click**
